# C# Player's Guide â€” Practice Repository

This repository contains my solutions and exercises from following along with **The C# Player's Guide** by RB Whitaker.

## ðŸ“š Purpose

This repo serves as a personal learning log as I worked through the book, covering:
- Core C# syntax and fundamentals
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Basic input/output and control flow
- Custom types, methods, and encapsulation

## ðŸš§ Status

- âœ… All Chapter-based exercises completed

## ðŸ§  Why This Repo Exists

I'm learning C# as part of expanding my software development toolkit â€” with a focus on eventually building tools in .NET. This repo is not a polished project but a reflection of my hands-on practice and growth in the language.
